# Dive-Into-Deep-Learning
Concluding 10 coursework and 1 final projects. The course lead us to dive into various aspects of deep learning, including simple Softmax Regression/Classification, Logistic Regression/Classification; Convolutional Neural Networks like LeNet, ResNet and DenseNet; and Recurrent Neural Networks like GRU, LSTM (single layer and multi-layer). The repo includes experiments of constructing neural networks with MXNet (Amazon) on prestigious topics and datasets, like MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, IMDB dataset, stocks dataset, e.t.c. The projects was experimenting MXNet on Quora language dataset. It could be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/discussion.
